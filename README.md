This is an Application for Registering users
whether coporate, company or bank users
The App then is used to store leave data 
for employees .Used Session variable to  manage what is visible to the
user based on What they picked when they signed up
used Gridviews to display dat fro the data base and then buttons to display the data

used the C# language and the asp.Net Webform platform for C# to develop this Application
I also used MSSQL  server to build a database to give the app the ability to store the data i have registered
